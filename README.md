This repository contains the files from the Data Challenge I did as part of the 2022 University of Connecticut Sports Analytics Symposium. We were given a set of minor league baseball player tracking data, and told to design a project around it focused on defense or baserunning. Unfortunately, the data was not allowed to be disclosed, so that is not in this repository. The folder of results contains the results of the study, and the R file contains the code I used. Finally, the paper I wrote about the study is included.
